First, build & compile nachos. This is done by calling
the make command in the proj1 directory. This creates
an executable named nachos in the proj1 directory. Run
this executable to run nachos.

Nachos runs selfTest() methods, covering many test cases,
for the following classes:

- KThread.java
- Condition2.java
- Alarm.java
- Communicator.java
- ReactWater.java

These selfTest() methods produce no visible output by
default. Their output is made visible by enabling their
respective debug flags. This is accomplished by using the
-d command line option and listing the flags of interest
as an argument. The flags are listed with their respective
classes below:

- k	KThread.java
- c	Condition2.java
- a	Alarm.java
- C	Communicator.java
- r	ReactWater.java

For example, if someone was interested in the KThread
selfTest() output, they would enter the following:

nachos -d k

Alternatively, one could wish to see the output of the
selfTest() methods of multiple classes. They would then
enter the following:

nachos -d ac	//where 'ac' could be any combination of
		//the debug flags: k, c, a, C, r.
